# Crop-Disease-Detection
basic crops like wheat and rice are used as datasets. and simple python program has been created in jupyter and VS code to implement the code.
Open anaconda prompt:
Install tensorflow,keras, streamlit, numpy
open jupyter notebook
use datasets https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nizorogbezuode/rice-leaf-images , https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olyadgetch/wheat-leaf-dataset?resource=download
make a folder where these datasets are stored along with the jupyter files
in jupyter make a new file names "training" where we are gonna train the model. Use the training file. to increase the accuracy one ca change the model accordingly and increase the epochs .
now create another file named "testing" . 
after training and testing the model , Open VS code , 
open terminal and gie input " conda activate base \n conda actuvate tensorflow \n pip install streamlit \n streamlit run main.py"
write a python program for the user interface ( can take the main.py file as reference )
a localhost code will be made which u can run on yr browser .

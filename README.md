# Crop-Disease-Detection
## Description
This project  can be used as tool for widely assisting in the detection of diseases in crops like Wheat and Rice. 
basic crops like wheat and rice are used as datasets. and simple python program has been created in jupyter and VS code to implement the code.

## Installation 
1. Download Anaconda Prompt for your PC.(https://www.anaconda.com/installation-success?source=installer)
   <br>-In The Prompt run the commands [pip install tensorflow , pip install keras, pip install streamlit, pip install numpy]
2. Download VScode.(https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
## Usage
1.Cost Efficiency:
<br>Using this project helps in reducing the need for broad-spectrum chemical applications by targeting specific disease outbreaks lowers input costs and minimizes labor requirements.
<br>2.Sustainability:
<br>Precise application of the tests done by the project enhances the sustainability of the crops quality.
<br>3.Scalability:
<br>Detection systems can be scaled to various sizes of farming operations, from smallholder farms to large agricultural enterprises, making the technology available for all.
## Contirbution
1.Enhanced Yield and Quality:
<br>Early detection of diseases allows for timely intervention, which can prevent significant yield loss and maintain the quality of the produce. This ensures a stable supply of food and maximizes the profitability for farmers.
<br>2.Precision Agriculture:
<br>Integrating disease detection systems into precision agriculture practices enables targeted treatments, reducing the use of pesticides and fertilizers. This not only lowers costs but also minimizes environmental impact. The project has been trained thoroughly to deal with as many samples of crops as uploaded.
<br>3.Data-Driven Decisions:
<br>Modern detection systems often involve data analytics and machine learning, providing farmers with actionable insights based on patterns and trends. This project tends to store the previous tests and assists in the precise detection of diseases.This facilitates informed decision-making regarding crop management strategies.
